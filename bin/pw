# Encrypted password management script by Julian Thatcher
# Date: 17/08/15
#
# Manages passwords.txt.gpg. The user will be asked to input their symmetric
# key for encryption and decryption.
#
# Operations:
# pw clean              Clean intermediate files
# pw atlassian          Search for "atlassian" in password file
# pw search atlassian   Same as above
# pw -- clean           Consider the rest of the line to be searches, not commands
# pw -c NameOfService   Create a new service and open $VISUAL on the file
# pw commit "Message"   Commit the pending changes to git
# pw push               Push the pending changes
#
# Operations can be combined, and are run sequentially.
# Eg:
#  pw atlassian -c BitBucket commit "BitBucket account" push clean
#
#  This would show password matches for "atlassian"; create a new password
#  named BitBucket and open $VISUAL to allow you to add your password; then
#  a new commit would be added for the encrypted file
#  (message "BitBucket account"); push commits to origin; and finally clean
#  up intermediate files.
